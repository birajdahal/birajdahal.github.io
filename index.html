  <p>I am a PhD Candidate in Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, graduating in May 2026. I work in applied mathematics and data science, including generative modeling and scientific machine learning. More generally, I would like to apply mathematical frameworks (e.g. measure transport, differential geometry) to interesting problems, particularly involving high-dimensional data.</p>
  <p>I am always interested in new problems from "theoretical" to "applied". Please reach out if you would like to chat about research.</p>
